She has already tried one recipe a day after receiving the book.
I bought this zoku quick pop for my daughterr with her zoku quick maker.
She loves it and have fun to make her own ice cream.
I was hoping there were more where those came from.
This book emphasizes very sweet dessert pops, however.
There are 41 recipes in total, only 13 of which are fruit pops.
There is a "Fresh and Fruity" chapter, followed by three chapters of dessert pops entitled "I Scream for Quick Pops!", "Bake Shop", and  "Coco Loco".
As you might guess from the last one, there are 15 pop recipes that contain chocolate.Chapters on "Tips" and "Techniques" are useful.
There is more detailed information about ingredients that don't freeze well in the Zoku than is found in the instruction manual.
